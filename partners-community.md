# Community: In-kind donations & services

Community partners may prefer to engage through in-kind donations, services, or offerings that provide learners with practical open source experience. By donating tools, hosting workshops, or offering mentoring services, you can help equip our students with the skills and resources they need to excel in their careers. Examples of in-kind donations include resume writing workshops, resume reviews and mock interviews, access to software tools for the Community Developer Pack(e.g., Figma, GitHub Pro), hosting career panels and technical interviews, and providing mentorship and peer support programs.
