# About-All-In

This is a collection of resources relating to GitHub All In curriculum, communities, partners and DEI resources maintained by [GitHub Social Impact](link) under the [Skilling, Equity and Community pillar](link) at GitHub to enable and empower socially conscious open source developers.

## What is this Repo?
This repository is where we discuss and coordinate the GitHub All In open source efforts to establish pathways to guide underrepresented learners into the GitHub All In Alumni program, an equity-driven global community, to ensure broader and more inclusive participation in the digital economy. The four-point plan is as follows:

1. Increase the number of developers on GitHub through an openly accessible curriculum
2. Increase the number of marginalized and socially conscious developers on GitHub through large-scale skilling partnerships in targeted countries
3. Increase the number of marginalized and socially conscious developers on GitHub through local skilling partnerships in targeted countries
4. Drive positive and lasting contributions and close the digital divide through community building
